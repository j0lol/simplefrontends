# Simple frontends
(Trying to) create simple, CLI frontends for video websites and stuff

## twitch.sh

Gets status of twitch streamers (listed line by line in a text file) and displays them in a simple CLI. Lets you open their stream in MPV quickly.

### Todo
- Add "x is hosting y" support
- Figure out how to make a GUI then port this to pinephone? would be neat
