# Simple frontends
(Trying to) create simple, CLI frontends for video websites and stuff
(just dont look at the code, its messy)

## twitch.sh

Gets status of twitch streamers (listed line by line in a text file) and displays them in a simple CLI. Lets you open their stream in MPV quickly.

- Figure out how to make a GUI then port this to pinephone? would be neat

## youtube.sh

yea this isnt started yet. is going to be way more complicated than twitch.sh (simular to newpipe?)
